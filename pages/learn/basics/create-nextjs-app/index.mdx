To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

- Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
- You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
- You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
- You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A _framework_ can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

### Next.js: The React Framework

Enter **Next.js**, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js has the best-in-class "Developer Experience" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for <Link href="/docs/[[...slug]]" as="/docs/routing/dynamic-routes"><a>dynamic routes</a></Link>)
- <Link href="/docs/[[...slug]]" as="/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering">
    <a>Pre-rendering</a>
  </Link>
  , both <Link
    href="/docs/[[...slug]]"
    as="/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended"
  >
    <a>static generation</a>
  </Link> (SSG) and <Link
    href="/docs/[[...slug]]"
    as="/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering"
  >
    <a>server-side rendering</a>
  </Link> (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- <Link
    href="/docs/[[...slug]]"
    as="/docs/routing/introduction#linking-between-pages"
  >
    <a>Client-side routing</a>
  </Link> with optimized prefetching
- <Link href="/docs/[[...slug]]" as="/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support">
    <a>Built-in CSS</a>
  </Link> and <Link
    href="/docs/[[...slug]]"
    as="/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support"
  >
    <a>Sass support</a>
  </Link>
  , and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment which supports Hot Module Replacement
- <Link href="/docs/[[...slug]]" as="/docs/api-routes/introduction">
    <a>API routes</a>
  </Link> to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable

Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

### About This Tutorial

This free interactive course will guide you through how to get started with Next.js.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn Next.js basics by creating a very simple **blog app**. Here’s an example of the final result:
